Misson Return
Storyline: 
Abyss takes off from Earth, traveling millions of lightyears to research a blackhole. They enter the blackhole and are sucked in! This black hole has a powerful worm hole at its center, which allows beings to travel great distances through space-time (time travelers!). 
The worm hole leads the scientists back to the former location of earth, however hundreds of thousands (234,534 years after the year 2023) of years have passed and the earth has been corrupted by aliens. Although humanity still resides in the planet, they are being forced to hide due to the newfound colonizers.
